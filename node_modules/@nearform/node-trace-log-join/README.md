This fork of node-trace-log-join includes [this patch](https://github.com/mafintosh/node-trace-log-join/pull/1), and no other changes. This exists just to let Clinic.js use that patch. While the PR has not passed review yet, it is unlikely to make things worse in our specific case.

# node-trace-log-join

Easily combine multiple node_trace files into a single one

```

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/node-trace-log-join.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/node-trace-log-join)

## Usage

``` js
var join = require('node-trace-log-join')

join('node_trace.*.log', 'combined.log', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('All node_trace.*.log files have been combined into combined.log')
})
```

## API

#### `join(files, output, [callback])`

Combines all trace files into the output file and calls the callback.
All files are combined in a streaming fashion so the memory footprint is pretty small.

Alternatively you can pass a file pattern instead of the the files array.

After the files are combined, the input files are unlinked as well.
